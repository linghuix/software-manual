 PREPROCESSOR WARNING MESSAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***WARNING: There are 12 warning messages in the data (.dat) file.  Please
            check the data file for possible errors in the input file.



***WARNING: Each of the nodes listed below (and included in node set
            "WarnNodeBcIntersectKinCon") participates in a boundary condition
            definition (*BOUNDARY) as well as being part of a kinematic
            contact definition (*CONTACT PAIR, MECHANICAL CONSTRAINT =
            KINEMATIC). If a degree-of-freedom participates in both types of
            constraints, the boundary condition will override the kinematic
            contact constraint. In case of a conflict, it is suggested that
            the penalty contact algorithm be used instead.

***WARNING: In contact pair 1, node 2493 of instance PART-BAN-1 on the slave
            surface ASSEMBLY_SURF-BAN has 444.19 times more mass than the mass
            of node 713 of instance PART-QIU-1 on the master surface
            ASSEMBLY_SURF-QIU. Significant contact noise may result with the
            kinematic contact algorithm when the slave nodes have
            significantly greater mass than the master nodes. Suggested
            workarounds include setting the WEIGHT parameter so that surface
            ASSEMBLY_SURF-QIU is a pure slave surface in the contact pair,
            using mass-scaling to adjust the ratio of nodal masses, or using
            the penalty contact algorithm.
